Implementing password rejection button in Omnis Studio

This is a fun demonstration of using the Omnis Studio Transform XComp.

On MacOS, when you enter an incorrect login password, the button "shakes it's head" to tell you that it was not correct.

Here I do the same thing in Omnis.

# src
Contains the Omnis Studio 10.22 library

# lib
Contains the JSON export of the library

# Demo
Contains a video demo of the window.
